# hello-world
I am new to coding, so I have much to learn!
I would love all the help that I can get to learn to code.
I am currently studying a Diploma of Software Development.
So far I have completed html5 & CSS to create a simple fluid website.
I am behind in my Python subject as it seems a bit more difficult.
Or, may be it is just the way it's being presented?
We are made to use an IDE, but I began to learn Python with
a text editor, a shell and Python.
Since my course uses an IDE I have to do this to pass
BUT I am finding the IDE makes me more confused!!!!
HELP!
